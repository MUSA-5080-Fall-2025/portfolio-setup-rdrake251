Overall Pattern Identification: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses? 2. Equity Assessment: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings? 3. Root Cause Analysis: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk? 4. Strategic Recommendations: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\nExecutive Summary:\n[1. Rural areas still contain many High MoE at the county level. When you transfer that to neighborhoods or groups of people, the MoE just increases (gets lower) because the sample size gets even smaller. This could pose potential issues in algorithmic analysis for policy recommendations and you really need to monitor the outcomes. 2. Smaller communities, like for instance Iowa has a very low population of Black people, would have extremely high MoE and would face greater risk of algorithmic bias. 3. The sample size. We also talked about human choice in all the steps like how you clean data, what you choose to classify (like MoE as high or medium what percent makes this decision?), to variables you put into the model. 4. There definitely needs to be checks as there are a lot of blind spots, especially it seems in rural areas where data quality and quantity are not as good as urban areas? One needs guardrails and other modes of analysis on top of algorithmic analysis.]"
