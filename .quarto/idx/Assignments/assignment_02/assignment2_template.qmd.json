Except Metro which is is NAD83. \n\n---\n\n#### Step 2: Get Demographic Data \n\nUse `tidycensus` to download tract-level demographic data for Pennsylvania.\n\n**Required variables:**\n- Total population\n- Median household income\n- Population 65 years and over (you may need to sum multiple age categories)\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Get demographic data from ACS\n# Define the ACS year and dataset\nyear <- 2021\nsurvey <- \"acs5\"\n\n# Get tract-level demographic data for Pennsylvania\npa_demo <- get_acs(\n  geography = \"tract\",\n  state = \"PA\",\n  year = year,\n  survey = survey,\n  variables = c(\n    total_pop = \"B01003_001\",         # Total population\n    median_income = \"B19013_001\",     # Median household income (dollars)\n    age_65_66 = \"B01001_020\",         # Male 65-66\n    age_67_69 = \"B01001_021\",         # Male 67-69\n    age_70_74 = \"B01001_022\",         # Male 70-74\n    age_75_79 = \"B01001_023\",         # Male 75-79\n    age_80_84 = \"B01001_024\",         # Male 80-84\n    age_85_up = \"B01001_025\",         # Male 85+\n    f_age_65_66 = \"B01001_044\",       # Female 65-66\n    f_age_67_69 = \"B01001_045\",       # Female 67-69\n    f_age_70_74 = \"B01001_046\",       # Female 70-74\n    f_age_75_79 = \"B01001_047\",       # Female 75-79\n    f_age_80_84 = \"B01001_048\",       # Female 80-84\n    f_age_85_up = \"B01001_049\"        # Female 85+\n  ),\n  geometry = FALSE  # Set TRUE later if you want spatial data\n)\npa_demo_summary <- pa_demo %>%\n  select(GEOID, variable, estimate) %>%\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = estimate) %>%\n  mutate(\n    pop_65_over = age_65_66 + age_67_69 + age_70_74 +\n                  age_75_79 + age_80_84 + age_85_up +\n                  f_age_65_66 + f_age_67_69 + f_age_70_74 +\n                  f_age_75_79 + f_age_80_84 + f_age_85_up\n  ) %>%\n  select(GEOID, total_pop, median_income, pop_65_over)\n\nhead(pa_demo_summary)\n\n\n# Join to tract boundaries\npa_tracts <- tracts(state = \"PA\", cb = TRUE, year = 2024)\npa_demo_joined <- pa_tracts %>%\n  left_join(pa_demo_summary, by = \"GEOID\")\n\npa_demo_joined\nplot(pa_demo_joined[\"median_income\"])\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What year of ACS data are you using?\n    - I tried to use the most recent data so I used 2024. I tried 2025 first but kept getting a Census Bureau error since that data isn't out yet obviously.I was just curious what it would do if I tried. \n    \n- How many tracts have missing income data?\n\n# Count tracts with missing median household income\n\nmissing_income_count <- pa_demo_joined %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_missing_income = sum(is.na(median_income)),\n    total_tracts = n(),\n    percent_missing = 100 * n_missing_income / total_tracts\n  )\n\nmissing_income_count\n\n\nA total of 65 tracts have missing income. \n\n- What is the median income across all PA census tracts?\n\n# median of tracts median household incomes\nmedian_income_pa <- pa_demo_joined %>%\n  summarize(\n    state_median_income = median(median_income, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nmedian_income_pa\n\nThe median income for all tracts is $65195.50. \n\n---\n\n#### Step 3: Define Vulnerable Populations \n\nIdentify census tracts with vulnerable populations based on TWO criteria:\n1. Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold)\n2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\npa_demo_joined <- pa_demo_joined %>%\n  mutate(\n    pct_65_over = 100 * pop_65_over / total_pop\n  )\nincome_threshold <- 40000\nelderly_threshold <- 20\n\nvulnerable_tracts <- pa_demo_joined %>%\n  filter(\n    median_income <= income_threshold,\n    pct_65_over >= elderly_threshold\n  )\n\nsummary(vulnerable_tracts$median_income)\nsummary(vulnerable_tracts$pct_65_over)\nnrow(vulnerable_tracts)\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What income threshold did you choose and why? \n\n    I didn't want to choose the poverty line because individuals (or families) who make just over can still be significantly impacted by income while not being eligible for benifits of programs. Though this is all of PA and not everywhere is as expensive as Philadelphia or Pittsburg but still thought it a fine threshhold. \n    \n- What elderly population threshold did you choose and why? \n\n  This one I had to google a bit to find a suitable threshold. I found that setting a threshold of 20, where 20% of the population is aged 65+ is considered \"significant elderly population.\"\n  \n- How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\n\n95 tracts in total. \n\n- What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?\n\n2.75% \n\n---\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals \n\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Transform to appropriate projected CRS\n\n#NAD83\npa_tracts_proj <- st_transform(pa_demo_joined, 26918)\nvulnerable_centroids <- vulnerable_tracts %>%\n  st_transform(26918) %>%\n  st_centroid()\n\n# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital\n\nhospitals_proj <- st_transform(hospitals, 26918)\n\ndist_matrix <- st_distance(vulnerable_centroids, hospitals_proj)\n\nvulnerable_centroids <- vulnerable_centroids %>%\n  mutate(\n    dist_to_nearest_hospital_m = apply(dist_matrix, 1, min),\n    dist_to_nearest_hospital_miles = dist_to_nearest_hospital_m * 0.000621371\n  )\n\nsummary(vulnerable_centroids$dist_to_nearest_hospital_miles)\nhead(vulnerable_centroids[, c(\"GEOID\", \"dist_to_nearest_hospital_miles\")])\n\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania\n- Calculate distances in miles\n- Explain why you chose your projection\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts?\n\nThe average distance to the nearest hospital is 2.61 miles. \n\n- What is the maximum distance?\n\nThe maximum distance is 18.68 miles. \n\n- How many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital?\n\nvulnerable_far <- vulnerable_centroids %>%\n  filter(dist_to_nearest_hospital_miles > 15)\n  \nsummary_far <- vulnerable_far %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_far = n(),\n    total_vulnerable = nrow(vulnerable_centroids),\n    percent_far = 100 * n_far / total_vulnerable\n  )\n\nsummary_far\n\nThere is only one tract that is more than 15 miles away from the nearest hospital. \n---\n\n#### Step 5: Identify Underserved Areas \n\nDefine \"underserved\" as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Create underserved variable\n\nvulnerable_centroids <- vulnerable_centroids %>%\n  mutate(\n    underserved = dist_to_nearest_hospital_miles > 15\n  )\n\nunderserved_summary <- vulnerable_centroids %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_underserved = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_vulnerable = n(),\n    percent_underserved = 100 * n_underserved / total_vulnerable\n  )\n\nunderserved_summary\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- How many tracts are underserved?\n\n  There is still jsut one underserved tract. \n  \n- What percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved?\n\n  1%\n\n- Does this surprise you? Why or why not?\n\nYes, I thought there would be more in more rural areas of PA. \n\n---\n\n#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level\n\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Spatial join tracts to counties\nvulnerable_centroids <- st_transform(vulnerable_centroids, st_crs(pa_counties))\npa_counties <- st_transform(pa_counties, st_crs(vulnerable_centroids))\n\nvulnerable_with_county <- st_join(vulnerable_centroids, pa_counties, join = st_within)\n\n# Aggregate statistics by county\n\ncounty_stats <- vulnerable_with_county %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  group_by(county_name = NAMELSADCO) %>% \n  summarize(\n    n_vulnerable_tracts = n(),\n    n_underserved_tracts = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE),\n    pct_underserved = 100 * n_underserved_tracts / n_vulnerable_tracts,\n    avg_dist_miles = mean(dist_to_nearest_hospital_miles, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_vulnerable_pop = sum(total_pop, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(n_underserved_tracts))\nhead(county_stats)\n\n```\n\n**Required county-level statistics:**\n- Number of vulnerable tracts\n- Number of underserved tracts  \n- Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\n- Average distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts\n- Total vulnerable population\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts?\n\n     Cameron County, 100%\n    \n- Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?\n  \n    Allegheny, Cambria, Beaver, Vlair, Berks, and Cameron\n\n- Are there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n\n  Mostly they are rural counties except for Allegheny. \n\n---\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table \n\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Create and format priority counties table\n\ncounty_stats <- county_stats %>%\n  mutate(\n    pct_vulnerable = 100 * n_vulnerable_tracts / sum(n_vulnerable_tracts)\n  )\n\n#Put Cameron on the top regardless of vulnerable rank\ncameron <- county_stats %>%\n  filter(county_name == \"Cameron\") %>%\n  mutate(county_name = paste0(\"**\", county_name, \"**\"))  \nothers <- county_stats %>%\n  filter(county_name != \"Cameron\") %>%\n  arrange(desc(pct_vulnerable))\npriority_counties <- bind_rows(cameron, others)\n\n#Select top 10 counties by % vulnerable tracts\npriority_counties <- priority_counties %>%\n  select(\n    county_name,\n    n_vulnerable_tracts,\n    n_underserved_tracts,\n    pct_vulnerable,\n    avg_dist_miles,\n    total_vulnerable_pop\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    pct_vulnerable = round(pct_vulnerable, 1),\n    avg_dist_miles = round(avg_dist_miles, 1),\n    total_vulnerable_pop = prettyNum(total_vulnerable_pop, big.mark = \",\")\n  )\n\n#Display the table\nlibrary(knitr)\npriority_counties_top10 <- priority_counties %>% slice_head(n = 10)\nkable(priority_counties_top10,\n      caption = \"Top 10 Priority Counties for Healthcare Investment in Pennsylvania\",\n      col.names = c(\"County\",\n                    \"Vulnerable Tracts\",\n                    \"Underserved Tracts\",\n                    \"% Vulnerable\",\n

Except Metro which is is NAD83. \n\n---\n\n#### Step 2: Get Demographic Data \n\nUse `tidycensus` to download tract-level demographic data for Pennsylvania.\n\n**Required variables:**\n- Total population\n- Median household income\n- Population 65 years and over (you may need to sum multiple age categories)\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Get demographic data from ACS\n# Define the ACS year and dataset\nyear <- 2021\nsurvey <- \"acs5\"\n\n# Get tract-level demographic data for Pennsylvania\npa_demo <- get_acs(\n  geography = \"tract\",\n  state = \"PA\",\n  year = year,\n  survey = survey,\n  variables = c(\n    total_pop = \"B01003_001\",         # Total population\n    median_income = \"B19013_001\",     # Median household income (dollars)\n    age_65_66 = \"B01001_020\",         # Male 65-66\n    age_67_69 = \"B01001_021\",         # Male 67-69\n    age_70_74 = \"B01001_022\",         # Male 70-74\n    age_75_79 = \"B01001_023\",         # Male 75-79\n    age_80_84 = \"B01001_024\",         # Male 80-84\n    age_85_up = \"B01001_025\",         # Male 85+\n    f_age_65_66 = \"B01001_044\",       # Female 65-66\n    f_age_67_69 = \"B01001_045\",       # Female 67-69\n    f_age_70_74 = \"B01001_046\",       # Female 70-74\n    f_age_75_79 = \"B01001_047\",       # Female 75-79\n    f_age_80_84 = \"B01001_048\",       # Female 80-84\n    f_age_85_up = \"B01001_049\"        # Female 85+\n  ),\n  geometry = FALSE  # Set TRUE later if you want spatial data\n)\npa_demo_summary <- pa_demo %>%\n  select(GEOID, variable, estimate) %>%\n  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = variable, values_from = estimate) %>%\n  mutate(\n    pop_65_over = age_65_66 + age_67_69 + age_70_74 +\n                  age_75_79 + age_80_84 + age_85_up +\n                  f_age_65_66 + f_age_67_69 + f_age_70_74 +\n                  f_age_75_79 + f_age_80_84 + f_age_85_up\n  ) %>%\n  select(GEOID, total_pop, median_income, pop_65_over)\n\nhead(pa_demo_summary)\n\n\n# Join to tract boundaries\npa_tracts <- tracts(state = \"PA\", cb = TRUE, year = 2024)\npa_demo_joined <- pa_tracts %>%\n  left_join(pa_demo_summary, by = \"GEOID\")\n\npa_demo_joined\nplot(pa_demo_joined[\"median_income\"])\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What year of ACS data are you using?\n    - I tried to use the most recent data so I used 2024. I tried 2025 first but kept getting a Census Bureau error since that data isn't out yet obviously.I was just curious what it would do if I tried. \n    \n- How many tracts have missing income data?\n\n# Count tracts with missing median household income\n\nmissing_income_count <- pa_demo_joined %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_missing_income = sum(is.na(median_income)),\n    total_tracts = n(),\n    percent_missing = 100 * n_missing_income / total_tracts\n  )\n\nmissing_income_count\n\n\nA total of 65 tracts have missing income. \n\n- What is the median income across all PA census tracts?\n\n# median of tracts median household incomes\nmedian_income_pa <- pa_demo_joined %>%\n  summarize(\n    state_median_income = median(median_income, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nmedian_income_pa\n\nThe median income for all tracts is $65195.50. \n\n---\n\n#### Step 3: Define Vulnerable Populations \n\nIdentify census tracts with vulnerable populations based on TWO criteria:\n1. Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold)\n2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\npa_demo_joined <- pa_demo_joined %>%\n  mutate(\n    pct_65_over = 100 * pop_65_over / total_pop\n  )\nincome_threshold <- 40000\nelderly_threshold <- 20\n\nvulnerable_tracts <- pa_demo_joined %>%\n  filter(\n    median_income <= income_threshold,\n    pct_65_over >= elderly_threshold\n  )\n\nsummary(vulnerable_tracts$median_income)\nsummary(vulnerable_tracts$pct_65_over)\nnrow(vulnerable_tracts)\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What income threshold did you choose and why? \n\n    I didn't want to choose the poverty line because individuals (or families) who make just over can still be significantly impacted by income while not being eligible for benifits of programs. Though this is all of PA and not everywhere is as expensive as Philadelphia or Pittsburg but still thought it a fine threshhold. \n    \n- What elderly population threshold did you choose and why? \n\n  This one I had to google a bit to find a suitable threshold. I found that setting a threshold of 20, where 20% of the population is aged 65+ is considered \"significant elderly population.\"\n  \n- How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\n\n95 tracts in total. \n\n- What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?\n\n2.75% \n\n---\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals \n\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Transform to appropriate projected CRS\n\n#NAD83\npa_tracts_proj <- st_transform(pa_demo_joined, 26918)\nvulnerable_centroids <- vulnerable_tracts %>%\n  st_transform(26918) %>%\n  st_centroid()\n\n# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital\n\nhospitals_proj <- st_transform(hospitals, 26918)\n\ndist_matrix <- st_distance(vulnerable_centroids, hospitals_proj)\n\nvulnerable_centroids <- vulnerable_centroids %>%\n  mutate(\n    dist_to_nearest_hospital_m = apply(dist_matrix, 1, min),\n    dist_to_nearest_hospital_miles = dist_to_nearest_hospital_m * 0.000621371\n  )\n\nsummary(vulnerable_centroids$dist_to_nearest_hospital_miles)\nhead(vulnerable_centroids[, c(\"GEOID\", \"dist_to_nearest_hospital_miles\")])\n\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania\n- Calculate distances in miles\n- Explain why you chose your projection\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts?\n\nThe average distance to the nearest hospital is 2.61 miles. \n\n- What is the maximum distance?\n\nThe maximum distance is 18.68 miles. \n\n- How many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital?\n\nvulnerable_far <- vulnerable_centroids %>%\n  filter(dist_to_nearest_hospital_miles > 15)\n  \nsummary_far <- vulnerable_far %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_far = n(),\n    total_vulnerable = nrow(vulnerable_centroids),\n    percent_far = 100 * n_far / total_vulnerable\n  )\n\nsummary_far\n\nThere is only one tract that is more than 15 miles away from the nearest hospital. \n---\n\n#### Step 5: Identify Underserved Areas \n\nDefine \"underserved\" as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Create underserved variable\n\nvulnerable_centroids <- vulnerable_centroids %>%\n  mutate(\n    underserved = dist_to_nearest_hospital_miles > 15\n  )\n\nunderserved_summary <- vulnerable_centroids %>%\n  summarize(\n    n_underserved = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_vulnerable = n(),\n    percent_underserved = 100 * n_underserved / total_vulnerable\n  )\n\nunderserved_summary\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- How many tracts are underserved?\n\n  There is still jsut one underserved tract. \n  \n- What percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved?\n\n  1%\n\n- Does this surprise you? Why or why not?\n\nYes, I thought there would be more in more rural areas of PA. \n\n---\n\n#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level\n\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Spatial join tracts to counties\nvulnerable_centroids <- st_transform(vulnerable_centroids, st_crs(pa_counties))\npa_counties <- st_transform(pa_counties, st_crs(vulnerable_centroids))\n\nvulnerable_with_county <- st_join(vulnerable_centroids, pa_counties, join = st_within)\n\n# Aggregate

TRUE),\n    total_vulnerable_pop = sum(total_pop, na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) %>%\n  arrange(desc(n_underserved_tracts))\nhead(county_stats)\n\n```\n\n**Required county-level statistics:**\n- Number of vulnerable tracts\n- Number of underserved tracts  \n- Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\n- Average distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts\n- Total vulnerable population\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts?\n\n     Cameron County, 100%\n    \n- Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?\n  \n    Allegheny, Cambria, Beaver, Vlair, Berks, and Cameron\n\n- Are there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n\n  Mostly they are rural counties except for Allegheny. \n\n---\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table \n\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n#

Challenge Options\n\nChoose ONE of the following challenge exercises, or propose your own research question using OpenDataPhilly data (https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/). \n\n**Note these are just loose suggestions to spark ideas - follow or make your own as the data permits and as your ideas evolve. This analysis should include bringing in your own dataset, ensuring the projection/CRS of your layers align and are appropriate for the analysis (not lat/long or geodetic coordinate systems). The analysis portion should include some combination of spatial and attribute operations to answer a relatively straightforward question**\n\n---\n\n#### Education & Youth Services\n\n**Option A: Educational Desert Analysis**\n- **Data:** Schools, Libraries, Recreation Centers, Census tracts (child population)\n- **Question:** \"Which neighborhoods lack adequate educational infrastructure for children?\"\n- **Operations:** Buffer schools/libraries (0.5 mile walking distance), identify coverage gaps, overlay with child population density\n- **Policy relevance:** School district planning, library placement, after-school program siting\n\n**Option B: School Safety Zones**\n- **Data:** Schools, Crime Incidents, Bike Network\n- **Question:** \"Are school zones safe for walking/biking, or are they crime hotspots?\"\n- **Operations:** Buffer schools (1000ft safety zone), spatial join with crime incidents, assess bike infrastructure coverage\n- **Policy relevance:** Safe Routes to School programs, crossing guard placement\n\n---\n\n#### Environmental Justice\n\n**Option C: Green Space Equity** \n- **Data:** Parks, Street Trees, Census tracts (race/income demographics)\n- **Question:** \"Do low-income and minority neighborhoods have equitable access to green space?\"\n- **Operations:** Buffer parks (10-minute walk = 0.5 mile), calculate tree canopy or park acreage per capita, compare by demographics\n- **Policy relevance:** Climate resilience, environmental justice, urban forestry investment\n---\n\n#### Public Safety & Justice\n\n**Option D: Crime & Community Resources**\n- **Data:** Crime Incidents, Recreation Centers, Libraries, Street Lights\n- **Question:** \"Are high-crime areas underserved by community resources?\"\n- **Operations:** Aggregate crime counts to census tracts or neighborhoods, count community resources per area, spatial correlation analysis\n- **Policy relevance:** Community investment, violence prevention strategies\n---\n\n#### Infrastructure & Services\n\n**Option E: Polling Place Accessibility**\n- **Data:** Polling Places, SEPTA stops, Census tracts (elderly population, disability rates)\n- **Question:** \"Are polling places accessible for elderly and disabled voters?\"\n- **Operations:** Buffer polling places and transit stops, identify vulnerable populations, find areas lacking access\n- **Policy relevance:** Voting rights, election infrastructure, ADA compliance\n\n---\n\n#### Health & Wellness\n\n**Option F: Recreation & Population Health**\n- **Data:** Recreation Centers, Playgrounds, Parks, Census tracts (demographics)\n- **Question:** \"Is lack of recreation access associated with vulnerable populations?\"\n- **Operations:** Calculate recreation facilities per capita by neighborhood, buffer facilities for walking access, overlay with demographic indicators\n- **Policy relevance:** Public health investment, recreation programming, obesity prevention\n\n---\n\n#### Emergency Services\n\n**Option G: EMS Response Coverage**\n- **Data:** Fire Stations, EMS stations, Population density, High-rise buildings\n- **Question:** \"Are population-dense areas adequately covered by emergency services?\"\n- **Operations:** Create service area buffers (5-minute drive = ~2 miles), assess population coverage, identify gaps in high-density areas\n- **Policy relevance:** Emergency preparedness, station siting decisions\n\n---\n\n#### Arts & Culture\n\n**Option H: Cultural Asset Distribution**\n- **Data:** Public Art, Museums, Historic sites/markers, Neighborhoods\n- **Question:** \"Do all neighborhoods have equitable access to cultural amenities?\"\n- **Operations:** Count cultural assets per neighborhood, normalize by population, compare distribution across demographic groups\n- **Policy relevance:** Cultural equity, tourism, quality of life, neighborhood identity\n\n---\n\n### Data Sources\n\n**OpenDataPhilly:** https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/\n- Most datasets available as GeoJSON, Shapefile, or CSV with coordinates\n- Always check the Metadata for a data dictionary of the fields.\n\n**Additional Sources:**\n- **Pennsylvania Open Data:** https://data.pa.gov/\n- **Census Bureau (via tidycensus):** Demographics, economic indicators, commute patterns\n- **TIGER/Line (via tigris):** Geographic boundaries\n\n### Recommended Starting Points\n\n**If you're feeling confident:** Choose an advanced challenge with multiple data layers. \n**If you are a beginner, choose something more manageable that helps you understand the basics**\n\n\n**If you have a different idea:** Propose your own question! Just make sure:\n- You can access the spatial data\n- You can perform at least 2 spatial operations\n\n### Your Analysis\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n1. **Find and load additional data**\n   - Document your data source\n   - Check and standardize the CRS\n   - Provide basic summary statistics\n\n```{r}\n# Load your additional dataset\n\nstate_parks <- st_read(here(\"Assignments/assignment_02/data/DCNR_StateParks202503.geojson\"))\nstate_parks <- st_transform(state_parks, crs = 2272)\n\nst_crs(state_parks)\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What dataset did you choose and why?\n  I chose the DCNR State Parks data set to see state park acess and vizualize distribution per captia.\n  \n- What is the data source and date?\n  DCNR and 2025. \n\n- How many features does it contain?\nIt contains 12 features. \n\n- What CRS is it in? Did you need to transform it?\n\nIt is in NAD83, I think this is fine for PA. \n\n---\n\n2. **Pose a research question**\n\nWhat is the state park acreage per capita by county in Pennsylvania? Which counties have the most state park acerages? Where are there Park and Ride locations in the state which are usually a way for underserved populations to access state parks? \n\n---\n\n3. **Conduct spatial analysis**\n\nUse at least TWO spatial operations to answer your research question.\n\n**Required operations (choose 2+):**\n- Buffers\n- Spatial joins\n- Spatial filtering with predicates\n- Distance calculations\n- Intersections or unions\n- Point-in-polygon aggregation\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Your spatial analysis\nstate_parks <- st_read(here(\"Assignments/assignment_02/data/DCNR_StateParks202503.geojson\"))\nstate_parks <- st_transform(state_parks, crs = 2272)\n\n#get acreage \nstate_parks <- state_parks %>%\n  mutate(area_sqft = st_area(geometry),\n         area_acres = as.numeric(area_sqft) / 43560)\n\npa_counties <- st_transform(pa_counties, st_crs(state_parks))\n\nparks_by_county <- st_intersection(state_parks, pa_counties) %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  group_by(county_name) %>%\n  summarise(total_park_acres = sum(area_acres, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n#total poulation by county\npa_population <- get_acs(\n  geography = \"county\",\n  variables = \"B01003_001\",  #
