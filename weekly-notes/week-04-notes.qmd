## Key Concepts Learned
- [Did some review of GIS and mapping in R]
- [Now getting into what you can do with spacial data.]

## Coding Techniques
- [geojson are amazing rather than shapefiles - so easy!]
- [getting more comfortable with different spacial analysis]

## Questions & Challenges
- [There is a lot to know about projections and selecting the correct projections.]
- [See Line 369 for next steps for Assignemnt 2 in the Inclass practice since we didn't get to it.]

## Connections to Policy
- [PROJECTIONS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE SPACIAL DATA IS ACCURATELY PORTRAYED BEST]

## Reflection
- [I really liked the history of projections and development of the mapping. Honestly walking through the lecture codes was extremely helpful. ]
- [I enjoy the pace of this class, it is very helpful to learn the background of the code and what it means.]
